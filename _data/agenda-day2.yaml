- title: Unravelling the Complexities of Compensation
  speaker: Keisha Mistry
  desc: Most people have no idea if they’re being compensated fairly. According to an article from HBR, over 60% of respondents in their study undervalued their pay against industry standards for their role.<br/><br/>As a candidate looking for a new job or as an employee looking for a promotion, how do you know if the number that you’re being offered is fair? The answer is as simple as understanding derivatives in calculus.<br/><br/>Let’s start with the fact that salary is not the only contributing factor to compensation. It also includes vacation days, extended health benefits, professional development and the list could go on. You could be miscalculating hundreds (and hopefully not thousands) of dollars!<br/><br/>In this talk, “Unravelling the Complexities of Compensation” I will simplify the basics of compensation theory, break down the different facets of compensation and prepare you to ask the right questions in your next negotiation. You will leave this talk feeling empowered with the knowledge and understanding to take control of your compensation package. As Rihanna’s infamous saying goes ‘Pay me what you owe me’.

- title: Financial Diplomacy in Relationships
  speaker: Sam Anderson
  desc: Broaching the subject of personal finances can be difficult with a partner, especially if you both have different goals and plans on how to meet them. Discussions around money can turn very quickly in the wrong direction and both parties are left feeling frustrated. To make things worse, there really is no "right way" to talk about finances with your significant other. Every relationship is unique and how you communicate on this topic needs to take in account these idiosyncrasies. In this presentation, I hope to help you and your partner on your journey by sharing what did and did not work in my own personal relationship. And don't worry, we still very happy and well on our way in building the life we want together.
