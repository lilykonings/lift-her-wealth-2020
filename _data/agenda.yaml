- title: Redefining Your Compensation Strategy
  speaker: Keisha Mistry
  desc: 60% of women believe they are worth more than they are getting paid. The question becomes how can we start working towards changing this? Part of the answer lies in your compensation package. Most employees only consider salary as part of their compensation. The truth is there are many factors that can contribute to your compensation packages. It also includes vacation days, extended health benefits, flexible work, and the list could go on. You could be miscalculating hundreds (and hopefully not thousands) of dollars. In this talk, “Redefining your Compensation Strategy” I will break down the different facets of compensation and help you strategize your next negotiation. You will leave this talk feeling empowered with the knowledge to take control of your compensation and feel you’re being paid your worth.

- title: Financial Diplomacy in Relationships
  speaker: Sam Anderson
  desc: Broaching the subject of personal finances can be difficult with a partner, especially if you both have different goals and plans on how to meet them. Discussions around money can turn very quickly in the wrong direction and both parties are left feeling frustrated. To make things worse, there really is no "right way" to talk about finances with your significant other. Every relationship is unique and how you communicate on this topic needs to take in account these idiosyncrasies. In this presentation, I hope to help you and your partner on your journey by sharing what did and did not work in my own personal relationship. And don't worry, we still very happy and well on our way in building the life we want together.
