- question: Why is this free?
  answer: We believe it is important for womxn to have access to high quality content on career growth and personal finance. Our mission is to drive honest and valuable conversations about money and we feel charging our attendees contradicts that mission.

  answer: Select talks will be recorded and made available for replay but workshops and breakout rooms will only be available live.
- question: Can I attend anonymously?
  answer: Yes, we understand the sensitivity of certain topics and will not pressure you to share your real name. However, at least for registration, we require full name and your LinkedIn profile in order to dissuade those with potentially bad intentions. We want this to be a safe space and a stringent registration process helps that effort.
