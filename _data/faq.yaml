- question: Why is this free?
  answer: Our mission is to give womxn access to conversations about money and we feel charging our attendees contradicts that mission.
- question: Is this only available to womxn?
  answer: No, everyone is welcome to attend. We believe in inclusion and we expect everyone to adhere to our Code of Conduct no matter how they identify.
- question: Do I need to attend every event?
  answer: Not at all. Feel free to join in according to your schedule.
- question: Will replays be made available if I miss an event?
  answer: Select talks will be recorded and made available for replay but workshops and breakout rooms will only be available live.
- question: Can I attend anonymously?
  answer: Yes, we understand the sensitivity of certain topics and will not pressure you to share your real name. However, at least for registration, we require full name and your LinkedIn profile in order to dissuade those with potentially bad intentions. We want this to be a safe space and a stringent registration process helps that effort.
- question: What is your Code of Conduct?
  answer: We are dedicated to provide a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers and moderators. We also expect participants to respect the privacy of the speakers and fellow participants by not recording any of the content themselves. We will be providing post-recordings for any talks or workshops that have explicit consent from speakers.
